# cve-archive

It started with this: https://github.com/todb/junkdrawer/tree/master/cve-twitter-refs

I've been talking with @inokii about how to solve this, generally, for CVE references.

## The Plan So Far

@inokii suggested looking at using [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/) to process references, pulled from a cron job that scrapes out references from the published CVE lists (GitHub or MITRE's or whatever).

I'll give that a go. If that works, I'm now thinking we could seed some torrents of CVE references saved as WARC files or something. That way we can replicate at least the references in a disk-searchable way.

This will have much better fidelity going forward in time, as presumably, references linked today are much more likely to still be alive than a reference linked 10 years ago (we've already lost many races against linkrot).

This repo will store configurations and what all so someone other than us can replicate this work if they cared to.

Archiving is fun.
